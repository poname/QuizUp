1-First, I had to grab the node.js itself.
    in linux , it can be done using :
        apt-get install nodejs
    in windows, i had to grab the msi installation file from the offical site:
        https://cdn.socket.io/socket.io-1.2.0.js

2-i had to figure out how can i write a hello world! I went to their website and found a chat application demo.
so i created a folder in the application root called 'api' and cloned the git repository of chat application into it!

3-i looked briefly into the example , and as my point of view , it has two major parts , server and client.
the server uses the node.js languages and library , but the client was using the javascript library in pure javascript.

so i decided to put the javascript library into bower package manager(bower.json), and put the node.js required things into
 the api folder into node package manager(npm)

 finally , i ran two commands for checking out what i've got:
    bower --save install socket.io-clint // to get javascript required libraries
    cd api; npm install // to get node libraries required by chat demp app

 i ran into a problem when running the "npm install" command and it turns out PYTHON SHOULD BE INSTALLED ON SYSTEM

4. i changed javascript loading lines in api/index.html from http://cdn.... to http://localhost/quizup/lib/socket.io.js that i've gotten
from bower.

5. i ran node index.js and BANG!! :)


------------ Getting started to use

2.1 grab node.js executable( explained in section 1 above)
2.2 from cmd , change working directory to api folder,
2.3 run command "node index.js"
2.4 navigate to localhost:4101
